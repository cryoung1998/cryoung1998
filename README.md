- 👋 Hi, I’m @cryoung1998
- 👀 I’m interested in using coding to expand my abilities in the computation realm! I am especially interested in the connection between coding practices and electro-
mechanical applications (drones/autonomous cars/etc..)
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University with studies overlapping in mathematical sciences.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code to advance knowledge in UI functionality, Raspberry Pi applications, and simulation.
- 📫 You can reach me at cryoung@g.clemson.edu!
